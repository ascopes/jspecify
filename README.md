# JSpecify

An artifact of well-specified annotations to power static analysis checks and JVM language interop.
Developed by consensus of the partner organizations listed at our main web site, [jspecify.org](http://jspecify.org).

Our current focus is on annotations for nullness analysis.

The latest release is numbered 0.2 as a clear signal to **not** depend on it yet.
It will still undergo many changes.
